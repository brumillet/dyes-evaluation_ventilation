This GitHub repository contains one notebook which shows how the different figures were obtained.

The steady-state dyes used for the figures for the three models can be found at: https://www.seanoe.org/data/00927/103915/

The transient dyes and temperature and salinity fiels for the three models can be found at: https://www.seanoe.org/data/00958/106965/

To run the code, modify the data_path var for your repository where you store the data.

The steady-state dyes of the sensitivty experiments were not published, because of their size. If you would like to have access to it, please email me at bruno-millet@hotmail.com
