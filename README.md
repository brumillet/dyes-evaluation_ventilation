This GitHub repository contains one notebook that shows the analysis performed for the following manuscript:

Bruno Millet, Casimir de Lavergne, William Robert Gray, et al. Deep ocean ventilation: a comparison between a general circulation model and data-constrained inverse models. ESS Open Archive . December 27, 2024. https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.173532470.03609119/v1

The steady-state dyes used for the figures for the three models can be found at: https://www.seanoe.org/data/00927/103915/

The transient dyes, temperature and salinity fiels for the three models can be found at: https://www.seanoe.org/data/00958/106965/

To run the code, modify the data_path var for your repository where you store the data.

Detailed output from the sensitivty experiments were not published, because of their size. If you would like to have access to it, or any other unpublished model output, please email me at bruno-millet@hotmail.com. For the figures where the original data is not available (sensitivity experiments, velocities) you will find the processed arrays in the data folder as well as the different masks defined for this study.
