This GitHub repository contains one notebook which shows how the different figures of the following manuscript were obtained:

Bruno Millet, Casimir de Lavergne, William Robert Gray, et al. Deep ocean ventilation: a comparison between a general circulation model and data-constrained inverse models. ESS Open Archive . December 27, 2024. https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.173532470.03609119/v1

The steady-state dyes used for the figures for the three models can be found at: https://www.seanoe.org/data/00927/103915/

The transient dyes, temperature and salinity fiels for the three models can be found at: https://www.seanoe.org/data/00958/106965/

To run the code, modify the data_path var for your repository where you store the data.

The steady-state dyes of the sensitivty experiments were not published, because of their size. If you would like to have access to it, please email me at bruno-millet@hotmail.com. For similar reasons, the files needed to obtain the extrapolated ages were not shared. However, using the age after 6000y divided by the sum of the dyes should give about the same results, as described in the paper. The velocities used for the comparison with the reanalysis product were also not made publically available but can also be provided.
